      <p class="question">"What if there was a public service that supports people in having meaningful moments of creative expression?"</p>
      <p class="short">Open Expression Support (OES) is an experimental project, starting individual trajectories with members of the public to come to an experience of expression. An open service for those who would usually not come into contact with creative and expressive practices. It's about experimenting together and providing mutual support to reach a creative mode. To engage in a meaningful experience and to hold space to discover something new. OES is free and executed in public, for the public.</p>
      <p class="normal"> In this online space, I am documenting my endeavours in developing an Open Expression Support. Browse through creative exercises, listen to interviews, find snippets of theory I have come across, or read under <em>experiments</em> about the actual prototyping of OES, in which I'm doing experimental trials with several members of the public, exploring what OES could be.
