  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>There were 8 people that contacted me via email, sharing their interest in joining OES or 'Offene Ausdrucksberatung'. Although I planned to meet all of them, one man dropped out shortly after the first contact due to a newly acquired responsibility. Which leaves 7 of them, 2 men and 5 women. </p>
<p>Within the first email, several participants introduced themselves, whereas some waited for the first meeting to tell me in person. It was not until I met everybody that I knew who I was going to work with in the next 8 weeks, and the first patterns among the participants showed. Those patterns I reflect on at the end of the post about 'Session 1'.</p>
<p>There are 3 women in the age range of 50-60, 2 women aged between 20-30 and the 2 men are in the age range of 30-40. Everyone has German nationality, with one person having an immigration background.</p>
