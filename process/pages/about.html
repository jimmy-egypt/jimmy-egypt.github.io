    <div class="staticcontent"> <p>This is a process archive of Open Expression Support, a project initiated in July 2020. </p>
<p>What if there was a public service that supports people in having meaningful moments of creative expression? </p>
<p>Open Expression Support (OES) is an experimental project, starting individual trajectories with members of the public to come to an experience of expression. An open service for those who would usually not come into contact with creative and expressive practices. It's about experimenting together and providing mutual support to reach a creative mode. To engage in a meaningful experience and to hold space to discover something new about ourselves. OES is free and executed in public, for the public.</p>
<p>If you'd like to know more about the project and you happen to have some input, I'd love to hear all that. Write me at davide@kisd.de </p> </div>
