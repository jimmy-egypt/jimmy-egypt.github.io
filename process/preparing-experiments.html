    <p>Once the individual appointments were made, Open Expression Support could take off. Now it was up to me to prepare the first session and think of a general method, or rather a pedagogical approach to apply throughout the process. In this post, I want to share my thoughts and ideas on how to organise those 8 consecutive sessions. </p>
<p>To start with, it makes sense to go back to the original abstract in which I already formulated a series of principles (and their corresponding research questions) that would inform my personal experimental, pedagogical approach. For each of the principles, I'll share my preparations and strategy and I'll end by mentioning several hypotheses, speculating about the outcome of the experiments. Also serving as a way to remind myself of my original intentions.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>[Open Experimentation]</em> Organising sufficient space and time for experimentation by creating the necessary conditions to become creative. Starting with what is present, what do people already possess? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>[Place Language]</em> What does a space offer and what role does it play in allowing things to happen? What is a creative space?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>[Lightweight Structures]</em> How much structure is needed? Both for myself, as for the people participating. What structural elements are in place to support someone during such a trajectory? What kind of exercises/artefacts/frameworks need to be prepared to facilitate a moment? And how to treat those structures loosely?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>[Facing Slowness]</em> What and how long does it take for someone to ground, to rest and digest, with the present moment? How many sessions are needed to collectively get to this mode of expression? Can slowness be used as a device to provide space and time and therefore safety?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>[Making Collective]</em> During the experimentation, I regularly want to invite different practitioners to join the process and in this way, become part of the Open Expression Support. What to learn from peers who are active in the art scene and how to include them in the project? How to convince someone to take part? What is there in return? How to make members of the public aware of OES and seek contact? And how to make them part of the ‘collective’?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>[Opening a process]</em> An experimental open process, in public and to the public. Capturing experiments (with consent) and archiving selected moments in an accessible digital space. (www.openexpression.support) How to capture a moment? What format suits? With the process being the project, how to develop a good workflow of capturing and sharing work?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>[The ignorant master - Der unwissende Meister]</em> Following Jacques Ranciere’s belief in always starting from the equal capability of learning beings, viewing information and knowledge as announcements that everyone can do something with and make something out of each time, I want to practice such an attitude towards learning, as I am in fact, an ignorant master when it comes to this project. It’s not me that is offering coaching or therapy to my patients, clients, or users, it is David as a ‘Master student’ inviting members of the public, people, to experiment together and discover things about ourselves. To create conditions in which I, and the people that join me, will be out of control at moments, but remain open to accept the present situation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>[Action/Design Research]</em> Learning by doing through iteration, where research findings are incorporated in the practice as they are constructed. Working in cycles to: 1. study and plan, 2. take action, 3. collect and analyse results, 4. reflect and share with peers/professors to eventually execute the cycle again (and again).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>[Open Expression Support as organisation]</em> What if there was an open service that supports people in experiencing meaningful moments of creative expression? Seeing the Open Expression Support as an infinite project and possibly as designing a new public service, how to build a sustainable vision and long term strategy? What is the core activity and philosophy of such a collective? What settings can it be expanded to? Keeping the practice within the commons, how to monetize such an organisation/collective? And how can everyone involved receive a slice of the pie?</p>
</li>
</ol>
