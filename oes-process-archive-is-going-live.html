  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Right! Exciting.. Bueno, this is the start of the process archive of Open Expression Support, in which I will try to, well ... , gather and share a selected part of the process. As there will be valuable output generated along the way that I don't want to lose track of. Having this process archive pushes me to document in a structured and presentable manner. Let's see how that evolves.</p>
<p>The goal is to make this an easy to browse webspace with a variety of input. For now, I'm gathering creative exercises, doing interviews and writing notes (to self). Soon, there will be an experiments page, where I will share the planning, process and outcomes of different creative experiments with others. Which what it is all about. Hmm, a good manifesto would be nice too! </p>
<p>I'll try to update the website regularly, as long as I'm making progress. I'm currently planning the experiments, and facing the challenge of inviting (and convincing others) to join me. More about that later. Over and out!</p>
