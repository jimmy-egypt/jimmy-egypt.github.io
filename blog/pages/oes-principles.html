    <p>What if there was a public service that supports people in experiencing meaningful moments of creative expression? </p>
<p>Open Expression Support is an experimental project, starting individual trajectories with members of the public to come to an experience of expression. To experiment together and provide support to reach a creative mode. To engage in a meaningful experience and to hold space for each other to discover something new about ourselves. </p>
<p>Having experience in some fields more than others, the goal is to consult and include other practitioners (peers) with particular strengths in the process. For the time being, I envision the number of personal, one-on-one sessions to be once a week (1,5h?) for 8 consecutive weeks, aiming for 6-10 participants in the first round of experiments. Open Expression Support is free and executed in public, for the public.</p>
